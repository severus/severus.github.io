# Fedora

Fedora is a community-supported and produced Linux distribution that makes it easy for users to consume and contribute to leading-edge open source technologies from the kernel to the cloud. As a cutting edge development platform where every level of the stack is open to revision and improvement, Fedora serves as the upstream project on which future Red Hat Enterprise Linux releases are based.
